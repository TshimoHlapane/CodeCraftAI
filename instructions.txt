please divide the work for this project amongst myself , Lukhanyo, Mike, Violet & Jasper:

Objective

This assignment evaluates your understanding of AI applications in software engineering throughÂ theoretical analysis,Â practical implementation, andÂ ethical reflection. You will demonstrate how AI can automate tasks, enhance decision-making, and address challenges in software development.

Submission Guidelines

Code: Well-commented scripts/notebooks. (Shared on Github)

Report: PDF with answers, screenshots, and reflections. (Shared on Community as an article)

Presentation: A 3-minute video demo of your AI implementation. (Shared in Groups for Peer reviews)

Grading Rubric

Criteria	Weight
Theoretical Depth & Accuracy	30%
Code Functionality & Quality	50%
Ethical Reflection	10%
Creativity & Presentation	10%
Tools & Resources

AI Tools: GitHub Copilot, Testim.io, Google Colab.

Datasets: Kaggle, GitHub Issues.

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Selenium.

Why This Matters

Career Relevance: Mastery of AI tools like Copilot and Selenium is highly sought after in tech roles.

Ethical Awareness: Prepares you to build fair and inclusive AI-driven software.

Deadline: 7 days. Letâ€™s engineer smarter software! ðŸš€

Need Help?

Use documentation:Â GitHub Copilot,Â Testim.

Pro Tip: Start early and test incrementallyâ€”AI thrives on iteration! ðŸ”„


Part 1: Theoretical AnalysisÂ (30%)

1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?

Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

2. Case Study Analysis

Read the article:Â AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines.

Answer: How does AIOps improve software deployment efficiency? Provide two examples.

Part 2: Practical ImplementationÂ (60%)

Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

Tool: Use a code completion tool like GitHub Copilot or Tabnine.

Task:

Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

Compare the AI-suggested code with your manual implementation.

Document which version is more efficient and why.

Deliverable: Code snippets + 200-word analysis.

Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

Framework: Use Selenium IDE with AI plugins or Testim.io.

Task:

Automate a test case for a login page (valid/invalid credentials).

Run the test and capture results (success/failure rates).

Explain how AI improves test coverage compared to manual testing.

Deliverable: Test script + screenshot of results + 150-word summary.

Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

Dataset: Use Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/iuss-23-24-automatic-diagnosis-breast-cancer/data

Goal:

Preprocess data (clean, label, split).

Train a model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict issue priority (high/medium/low).

Evaluate using accuracy and F1-score.

Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook + performance metrics.

Part 3: Ethical ReflectionÂ (10%)

Prompt: Your predictive model from Task 3 is deployed in a company. Discuss:

Potential biases in the dataset (e.g., underrepresented teams).

How fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 could address these biases.

Bonus Task (Extra 10%)

Innovation Challenge: Propose an AI tool to solve a software engineering problem not covered in class (e.g., automated documentation generation).

Deliverable: 1-page proposal outlining the toolâ€™s purpose, workflow, and impact.
